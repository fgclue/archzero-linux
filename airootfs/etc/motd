Arch Linux, but without the pain.

Welcome to ArchZero Linux! If you are seeing this outside of a terminal window, then there is a problem with your ISO, or something else. ArchZero is meant to start in a KDE desktop enviroment, with a bar, etc.

If you are seeing this in a terminal window instead, then there is no problem.

If you are seeing this on a tty, try rebooting, and if that still doesn't work, try re-flashing your ISO. If you just wanna launch plasma now and have a change of getting a broken install, run `exec plasma-wayland` or `exec plasma-x11`
